A simple opinionated yaml formatter that keeps your comments!

# Installing

```bash
pip install yamlfix
```

# Usage

Imagine we've got the following source code:

```yaml
book_library:
- title: Why we sleep
  author: Matthew Walker
- title: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
  author: Eliezer Yudkowsky
```

It has the following errors:

* There is no `---` at the top.
* The indentation is all wrong.

After running `yamlfix` the resulting source code will be:

```yaml
---
book_library:
  - title: Why we sleep
    author: Matthew Walker
  - title: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
    author: Eliezer Yudkowsky
```

`yamlfix` can be used both as command line tool and as a library.

* As a command line tool:

    ```bash
    $: yamlfix file.yaml
    ```

* As a library:

    ```python
    from yamlfix import fix_files

    fix_files(['file.py'])
    ```

    If instead of reading from a file you want to fix the code saved into
    a variable, use `fix_code`:

    ```python
    {! examples/fix_code.py !}
    ```

# Features

yamlfix will do the following changes in your code:

* Add the header `---` to your file.
* [Correct truthy
    strings](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules.html#module-yamllint.rules.truthy):
    'True' -> true, 'no' -> 'false'
* Remove unnecessary apostrophes: `title: 'Why we sleep'` -> `title: Why we sleep`.
* [Correct comments](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules.html#module-yamllint.rules.comments)
* Ensure that there is exactly one newline at the end of each file, to comply with the [POSIX standard](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_206).
