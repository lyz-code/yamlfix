Issues \u00b6 Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as issues. To report a security vulnerability, please see our security policy instead. To make it as simple as possible for us to help you, please include the output of the following call in your issue: python -c \"import yamlfix.version; print(yamlfix.version.version_info())\" or if you have make installed, you can use make version . Please try to always include the above unless you're unable to install yamlfix or know it's not relevant to your question or feature request. Pull Requests \u00b6 yamlfix is released regularly so you should see your improvements release in a matter of days or weeks. Note Unless your change is trivial (typo, docs tweak etc.), please create an issue to discuss the change before creating a pull request. If you're looking for something to get your teeth into, check out the \"help wanted\" label on github. Development facilities \u00b6 To make contributing as easy and fast as possible, you'll want to run tests and linting locally. tl;dr : use make format to fix formatting, make to run tests and linting & make docs to build the docs. You'll need to have python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8, virtualenv, git, and make installed.

If you need to pass specific arguments to pytest use the ARGS variable, for example make test ARGs='-k test_markdownlint_passes' .

Once built it will serve the documentation at localhost:8000 : make docs Commit, push, and create your pull request.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#issues","text":"Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as issues.
